* ### Retrospective

**What went well?** - Activating the API key for Google Maps, working with the map and its features and the UI of the search page.<br>
**What went bad?** - Working with Google Maps' API to find the coordinates of a certain sports facility and with the interface while dealing with asynchronous programming in Flutter/Dart.<br>
**What problems are still to be fixed?** - Autocomplete/suggestions when inputting a location in the search bar, the facility page is not done and the database is still being populated.<br>

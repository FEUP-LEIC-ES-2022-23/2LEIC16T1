## Project management
You can find below information and references related with the project management in our team: 

* Backlog management: Product backlog and Iteration backlog in a [Github Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/projects/26);
* Release management: [v0](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC16T1/releases/tag/v0.1), [v1](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC16T1/releases/tag/v0.2), [v2](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC16T1/releases/tag/v0.3), v3, v...;
* Iteration planning and retrospectives: 
  * ### Iteration 1
     Start of Iteration
![board_start_iteration1](../images/productmanagement/iteration%231-start.png)
     End of Iteration
![board_end_iteration1](../images/productmanagement/iteration%231-end.png)

* ### Retrospective

**What went well?** - Activating the API key for Google Maps, working with the map and its features and the UI of the search page.<br>
**What went bad?** - Working with Google Maps' API to find the coordinates of a certain sports facility and with the interface while dealing with asynchronous programming in Flutter/Dart.<br>
**What problems are still to be fixed?** - Autocomplete/suggestions when inputting a location in the search bar, the facility page is not done and the database is still being populated.<br>

  * ### Iteration 2
     Start of Iteration
![board_start_iteration1](../images/productmanagement/iteration%232-start.png)
     End of Iteration
![board_end_iteration1](../images/productmanagement/iteration%232-end.png)

* ### Retrospective

**What went well?** - Working with the smartphone location and working with Firebase, in order to show the facility page.<br>
**What went bad?** - We faced difficulties in creating validation and unit tests for the application. The lack of guidance on how to make validation tests made it especially challenging. Additionally, the structure of our code made it less straightforward to create unit tests.<br>
**What problems are still to be fixed?** - We need to focus on developing more tests for the application.<br>
Throughout this iteration, we recognized that we could begin working on another user story. As a result, we initiated the development of login and registration features, and we successfully established a connection with the database.<br>

## Requirements

In this section, you should describe all kinds of requirements for your module: functional and non-functional requirements.


### Domain model

To better understand the context of the software system, it is very useful to have a simple UML class diagram with all the key concepts (names, attributes) and relationships involved of the problem domain addressed by your module. 
Also provide a short textual description of each class. 

Example:
